# What is *Wire*

[Wire](https://wire.com) is a an app for modern, private communications. It offers text, voice, video and sending media, and all user communication on Wire is end-to-end encrypted. It is available for iOS, Android, OS X, Windows, and modern web browsers.

We've released components of the app that take care of encryption and data handling as Open Source.

The [privacy page](https://wire.com/privacy/) and the [privacy](https://wire.com/resource/Wire%20Privacy%20Whitepaper/download/) and [security](https://wire.com/resource/Wire%20Security%20Whitepaper/download/) whitepapers explain the details of the encryption algorithms and protocols used.

# Wire architecture

The Wire mobile app has an architectural layer that we call *sync engine*. It is the client-side layer that processes all the data that is displayed in the mobile app. It handles network communication and authentication with the backend, push notifications, local caching of data, client-side business logic, signaling with the audio-video libraries, encryption and decryption (using encryption libraries from a lower level) and other bits and pieces.

The user interface layer of the mobile app is built on top of the *sync engine*, which provides the data to display to the UI.
The sync engine itself is built on top of a few third-party frameworks, and uses Wire components that are shared between platforms for cryptography (Proteus/Cryptobox) and audio-video signaling (AVS).

We are looking into releasing more components in the future. For the moment, we provide source code for encryption (Proteus/Cryptobox) and data handling (Sync Engine and AVS).

## iOS

*ZMessaging-cocoa* is the top-most layer of the iOS *sync engine*, and it is using on a number of lower-level frameworks. *ZMessaging-cocoa* and the lower-lever frameworks constitute the iOS *sync engine*, as illustrated in the following picture.

![iOS architecture](/assets/ios-architecture.png?raw=true "iOS architecture")

The iOS sync engine is developed in a mix of Objective-C and Swift (and just a handful of classes in Objective-C++). It is a result of a long development process that was started in Objective-C when Swift was not yet available. In the past year, parts of it have been written or rewritten in Swift. Going forward, expect new functionalities to be developed almost exclusively in Swift.

## Web App & Native Apps

Wire's web application (called “Wire for Web”) is a web application which runs in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Opera). It's core is written in CoffeeScript and automatically transpiled into JavaScript. Wire for Windows and Wire for OS X are native applications powered by [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and embedding (wrapping) Wire's web application.
